          <p class="page-title-p">
            Writing this on the last hours of the long, 4-day weekend! 3 work days more to come this week. Remember what I've written in September? I kinda
            stopped learning, and made less time for programming in October. That is mostly because of school, intense learning due to many tests, 
            extracurriculars, things like that. I started to learn PySimpleGUI, which is actually great and easy to use! I got some great game ideas, 
            that I could make in PyGame, but these are plans for next months. I was thinking about a 2d half-sandbox game, would work like a clone of Minecraft,
            but with my ideas of course. If somebody noticed, the website has been updated to support mobile devices! 
            Talking about Minecraft, in recent days, I've played more than usual, on my server CitiesBuild, and you can see some parts of it in my newest, at least 
            for now, video. I was more or less tired of algorithmic thinking and solving problems, I wrote an IT test in my school, and was preparing for it
            with my friend for way too long :D. There are also other contests from other subjects, I'm going to participate in these too. That's it for today,
            dziękuję for reading!

          <h2 class="page-title">Java, and PyGame thoughts (05.09.2022)</h2>
          <p class="page-title-p">
            Yeah, so I've been learning Java since, like, late August? It's tough. I chose it over Kotlin, which seems easier. I was thinking about making 
            Minecraft plugins for Spigot, I'll definitely try. School started, and it won't be an easy year, so I should (and will) focus more on science. 
            Also, about PyGame. I like it, I feel like I have control over I do in it, but it is kinda overwhelming, I think about C# and Unity, which I guess 
            would be a better choice, not only because Unity is supported on almost all of the platforms, it would be A LOT quicker, faster, and relaxing to 
            not struggle with PyGame, but with something that I could do more in. And if you haven't heared about PowerPrompt, check it out, it's posted on 
            the Downloads page, as well as on the Projects one. <s>And don't forget to check out included with PowerPrompt, ToDo list, made by me!!!!!!</s>
            That's it for today!

          <h2 class="page-title">The new website is ready! (27.07.2022)</h2>
          <p class="page-title-p">
            I've been working for 2 hours on it, and I have finally done it! It looks really neat, at least for me. After I finish it, I'm planning to finish
            a PyGame course, I found one that's pretty great, and add dark mode to this site. I'm also thinking of a addicting, haha, game idea. Mayby I'll find 
            something interesting, and quietly copy it :D I would want to post here recent updates as frequently as possible, let's say mayby every 10 days? 
            By the way, have you watched The Paper House: Korea? It's a nice korean version of the original serial. For now, stay tuned for next post!
